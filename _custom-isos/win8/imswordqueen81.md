My own 8.1 updated ISO. It works.

**Download:** [MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/FylnwIIA#50mxXuEBwK0rsMElRpkHqDDkoxWb98gqzakZjIt3vA8)

**Pros:**
- Comes with all the important SKUs: *Core*, *Pro*, *ProWMC*, *Enterprise*, *Industry Pro & Enterprise*.
- Setup doesn't have the forced product key screen.
- Has .NET Framework 4.8 pre-installed.
- .NET 3.5 is pre-enabled.
- TLS 1.1/1.2 support.
- Has BypassESU Blue pre-installed.
- All SKUs were rebased so it consumes less storage space (at the expense of not being able to uninstall updates)

**Cons:**
- Only updated to 2023-12 level (Microsoft doesn't offer Security Only updates past 2024 and newer updates cause the OS to BSOD at startup).
