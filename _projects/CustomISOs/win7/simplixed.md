**Pros:**
- Comes will all Windows 7 SKUs (except for the N and E variants).
- Uses the Windows 10 setup (skinned a bit to look like Windows 7's) to support ESD files, so the ISO size will be smaller overall.
- Has .NET Framework 4.8 pre-installed.
- Has Visual C++ 2005-2022 pre-installed.
- Comes with SmartFix Tool pre-installed.
- Has Internet Explorer 11 pre-installed but you can revert back to Internet Explorer 8.
- Doesn't come with Microsoft Edge pre-installed.

**Cons:**
- The disk usage suffers due to the fact that the updates are uninstallable (the installed size is 19GB).
- Windows' trial is 3 days instead of 30.
